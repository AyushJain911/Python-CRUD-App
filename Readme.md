## Markdown File

1. Firstly, I installed Django, Python, and MySQL.
2. I finished the database setup in my MySQL Workbench.
3. I created a folder and opened it in VSCode, then created a virtual environment. I installed Django using pip, then with the help of the Django command, I created a project and moved into it and created an application.
4. After creating an application, in the `settings.py` file, in the `INSTALLED_APPS` array, I mentioned the app that I've created. In the database section, I specified all the database information.
5. In the `urls.py` file inside the project folder, I created the URL path for my app.
6. Inside the `urls.py` file of my app, I created all the routes that I needed.
7. Inside the `views.py` file, I created all the methods (create, read, delete) for the URLs and also imported some HTTP methods and forms for handling requests, responses, and forms.
8. For the HTML and CSS part, I created `static` and `template` folders inside my application.
9. For the database connection, I created a schema inside the `models.py` file.
